# Hello and welcome to my profile!  
I am an **educator and scientist** with a M.A. in Physics (Computational Biophysics) and a B.S. in Mathematical Physics.
Currently, I am transitioning to a **Data Science and Machine Learning** role. I am building my skills by developing projects of all shapes and sizes that showcase my coding ability, analytical mind, and background in math and science.  
Some of my core skills are: Python, data science & machine learning, communication of insights, and analysis of complex systems.  
My name is Richard. I am interested in data science, problem-solving, educational theory, and skill development. I am currently a science teacher in Denver, CO. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, camping, and expanding my knowledge of all things science and math.

## About Me:  
Education: B.S. Mathematical Physics | M.A. Physics  
Interested in: Data Science, Bioinformatics, and Machine Learning  
Currently working on: Automating tasks and building visualization tools for teachers and administrators  
Outside of working: Exploring the outdoors, gardening, and making others laugh    
## Featured Projects:  
**Thyroid Cancer Detection:** ML model to classify nodules as benign vs malignant  
**Red Wine Quality Prediction:** Predicting the quality rating for a selection of red wines.  
**Fruit Fly Gastrulation Tracking:** Using videos of fruit fly embryos to track the movement and shape of embryonic cells  
## Currently Learning:  
**Deep Learning Architecture:** I find it incredibly fascinating, but frustrating that there is no formalism for selecting layers.  
**Communication Theory:** I admire Claude Shannon and his contributions to electronic communication.  
**Flask/FastAPI:** It's an important tool for visualization and web applications.  
**Tableau:** I want to refine my dashboard and snapshot-building skills.  
**SQL/PySQL:** I know the basics, but I would like to become more proficient in warehousing and accessing data.
